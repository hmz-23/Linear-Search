# Linear Search

### Linear Search scans 1 item at a time, without jumping to any item.
The Worst-case & Average time complexity is O(N).
The Best-case is O(1).

#### DRY-RUN:
let's assume that we have an array of size 10000:

          The best-case complexity is O(1).
          The worst-case complexity will be O(10000).
